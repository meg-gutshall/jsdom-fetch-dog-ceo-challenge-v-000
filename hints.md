# Dog CEO Fetch Lab Hints

1. The first challenge was definitely the easiest. You just need to fetch the dog images and then render them at the top of the page.
2. In the second challenge, they want you to fetch the dog breeds and render them as <li> elements in a <ul>. For this, you’ll want to use object iteration on the data that is returned by your fetch request (review the JS Fundamentals: Object Iteration lesson). I found out afterwards that you don’t have to worry about rendering the subcategories for each breed in order to pass the tests (i.e. “boston”, “english”, “french” nested under “bulldog”).
3. The third challenge is just a matter of creating a function that will change the text color, and then passing it in as an argument to an event listener attached to the dog breed <li> element.
4. This last challenge was tricky… You need to be able to get the value from the drop down and then render only the dog breeds that start with the selected letter. That means you need to add an event listener to the drop down to monitor when its value changes, then create a function that filters (hint, hint!) the dog breeds by that value to pass in as an argument to the event listener. But before you render the list of filtered breeds, you have to clear out what has been rendered on the page already (the list of all dog breeds)… then you can render the filtered breeds in that same <ul> element.
